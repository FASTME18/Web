    Lyrics
    Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
    I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
    You'd be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
    Know you're all that I want this life
      
    I'll imagine we fell in love
    I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
    I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
    The ocean's colors on your face
        
    I'll leave my heart with your air
    So let me fly with you
    Will you be forever with me?
      
    My love will always stay by you
    I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, 
    I'll tell you I love you more
    It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
      
    I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you      
    I'll imagine we fell in love
    I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
    I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
      
    The ocean's colors on your face      
    I'll leave my heart with your air
    So let me fly with you
    Will you be forever with me?
